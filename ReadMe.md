## Jsonify functionality
Jsonify is a function provided by the framework that helps convert Python dictionaries or other objects into JSON format. It's commonly used when building web APIs or when you need to return JSON data as a response from your Flask routes.

### How it works

1. Input: You pass a Python dictionary or any object that is JSON serializable to the jsonify function as an argument.

2. Output: jsonify converts the input data into a JSON-formatted response.

3. Response Headers: Flask automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header to application/json, indicating that the response contains JSON data.

4. Status Code: By default, jsonify sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK), but you can also specify a different status code if needed.

### Benefits:

1. Convenient: jsonify simplifies the process of returning JSON responses by handling JSON serialization for you.

2. Automatic Content-Type header: Flask automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json, indicating that the response contains JSON data.

### Disadvantages:

1. Limited customization: jsonify may not provide as much flexibility for customizing the response headers or status codes compared to manually creating a Response object.


## Flask RESTful 
Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural style used in modern web development.
It simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs by providing a set of tools and conventions for defining resources, handling requests, and generating responses. 

### installation
As it is an extension it requires to be installed separately. We can install it using the following command
pip install Flask-RESTful

### how it works
1. Resources: In Flask-RESTful, resources are represented as Python classes that define the logic for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on specific endpoints. Each resource class typically corresponds to a specific type of data or functionality in your API.

2. Routing: Flask-RESTful provides a convenient way to define routes for your API endpoints using the Api class. You can map each resource class to a specific URL endpoint, and Flask-RESTful takes care of routing requests to the appropriate methods within your resource classes.

3. Request Parsing: Flask-RESTful includes functionality for parsing and validating incoming request data. You can define expected request parameters, headers, and payloads using the reqparse module, making it easy to handle and validate user input.

4. Response Formatting: Flask-RESTful simplifies the process of formatting responses in JSON or other formats commonly used in REST APIs. It includes built-in support for serializing Python objects into JSON format and automatically setting the appropriate Content-Type headers.

5. Error Handling: Flask-RESTful provides mechanisms for handling errors and returning appropriate error responses. You can define custom error handlers to handle specific types of errors, such as 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error), and return informative error messages to clients.

6. Authentication and Authorization: Flask-RESTful can be integrated with Flask extensions such as Flask-JWT or Flask-HTTPAuth to add authentication and authorization features to your API. This allows you to secure your endpoints and restrict access to authenticated users or specific roles.

Overall, Flask-RESTful simplifies the process of building REST APIs in Flask by providing a structured approach and a set of useful tools and conventions.

### Benefits:

1. Flexibility: This approach allows for greater flexibility in customizing the response, including specifying custom status codes and additional response headers.
2. Control: You have full control over the structure of the response and can easily include additional information alongside the data.

### Disadvantages:

1. Requires more manual work: Manually setting up the response headers and status codes may require more code and effort compared to using jsonify.


# Manual
Involves creating a Flask Response object, setting its headers and status code, and then encoding your data into JSON format before returning the response.

### How it works:

1. Create a Response object using the Response class provided by Flask:

This object represents the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client.

2. Setting response headers and status code:

You set the desired response headers using the headers attribute of the Response object.

Common headers to include are the Content-Type header (set to application/json to indicate that the response contains JSON data) and any other custom headers you may need.

You also set the HTTP status code using the status attribute of the Response object. This indicates the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found, etc.).

3. Encoding data into JSON format:

You encode your data into JSON format using the json.dumps() function from the Python standard library.

This function converts a Python dictionary (or any other JSON-serializable object) into a JSON-formatted string.

4. Returning the response:

Finally, you return the Response object from your route function.

Flask will automatically send the response back to the client with the specified headers, status code, and JSON data.

### Benefits:

1. Full control: You have complete control over the response headers, status codes, and other aspects of the response.

2. Customization: You can easily customize the response to include additional headers, set specific status codes, or handle special cases.

### Disadvantages:

1. Difficult to understand: This approach may require more lines of code hence can be difficult to understand compared to using jsonify.

2. Error-prone: Manually constructing the response object increases the chance of errors, such as incorrectly setting headers or status codes.
